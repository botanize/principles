Additional information about the development process and implementation can be found in its respective section. Background \u00b6 The mobility landscape is complex. People have individualized abilities, preferences, and mobility needs that shape preferences around where, when, and how they travel. Transit agencies and other mobility service providers, likewise, are extremely varied. The variety among transit agencies and other mobility service providers creates an opportunity for more people to have their mobility needs better met. But fulfilling this promise requires a level of interoperability and cooperation between transit agencies, other mobility service providers, and transportation technology companies that is yet to be realized. Over the course of the last decade, passengers have enjoyed increased access to mobile apps and real-time information to help them choose the modes, services, and trips that are right for them, but still lack a complete picture of their available options because of technical and political information silos \u2013 not to mention unequal access to technology. Nonetheless, expectations have risen, as real-time transit information, on-demand ride hailing, and micromobility options become embedded in daily life. More than ever, meeting the needs of travelers requires the complete interoperability of mobility data used by transit agencies, mobility service providers, and transportation technology companies. Vision \u00b6 More than ever, meeting the needs of travelers requires the complete interoperability of mobility data used by transit providers and transportation technology companies. All people can, equitably: Discover and make informed choices about their mobility options in scheduled and/or real-time by utilizing the highest possible quality of information with the least possible barriers to accessing that information; Maintain their privacy and security; and Travel with the minimum possible friction arising from accessing data related to their mode(s) of travel. Mobility service providers can: Interface with other mobility providers to meet riders\u2019 needs; Use the best available data to support analytics and real-time decision-making for their planning, scheduling, and operating needs; Select the best available technology and equipment to provide their service without vendor lock-in; and Easily use their data and data from other mobility service providers to increase rider satisfaction and the customer experience through service efficiency and service quality. Transportation technology companies can: Develop new and innovative approaches to serving the needs of mobility service providers and riders; Use widely-adopted open standards for the transmission of all data that allows transit agencies, other mobility service providers and travellers to meet their needs; Easily integrate with other companies\u2019 hardware and software to send and receive planning, scheduling, and operating data; and Quickly identify and resolve data issues with their products. Researchers can: Affordably access, process, and use data from a variety of mobility technology components without having to re-create data processing pipelines or obtain costly vendor licenses. Transportation System Managers can Easily access, aggregate, and cross-reference mobility operations and traveler needs data at a system level across transit providers and jurisdictions; Utilize mobility data in the context of land use, population, environmental, and other data to inform short- and long-range strategies and policy; and Support the above visions for other stakeholders. What is interoperability ? \u00b6 Interoperable technologies can natively exchange data in a format that each can understand. Interoperability enables: Travelers to see all relevant mobility options along with complete directions, travel time, reliability and cost in the trip planning application of their choice, because mobility service providers publish their availability using open standards . Trip planning applications to interpret the information published about transit vehicles\u2019s locations, trajectories, and estimated stop arrival times. Transit planners to understand the needs and experiences of riders in order to plan future service by enabling their transit planning applications (e.g. scheduling software) to directly use ridership, mobile data terminal (MDT) and location data from on-board hardware. Mobility service providers to more easily receive the mobility technology components that meet the needs of their uses because components are better integrated into a larger mobility technology system , in which the transmission and ingestion of data is utilizing open standards . Mobility service providers to insert or merge service alerts manually or dynamically generated from one system into another. A service planner for a mobility service provider to notify their arrival prediction software, the public, and other mobility service providers of detours in an open standard from the same, reliable source. Transit operators and other mobility service providers to easily and affordably cross-reference, quality-check, analyze, and report on operational system performance across multiple dimensions and indicators using data from multiple mobility technology components and systems . Transportation system managers are able to easily aggregate transportation demand data (e.g. number of intraregional transit trips served in a given month) from mobility service providers because they are available in an open standard . A transportation technology company to lower development and maintenance costs and increase predictability by having a clear understanding of how to interface with neighboring system components. In short, interoperability means everyone in the mobility industry can speak the same language when it comes to mobility data . Why is interoperability important? \u00b6 The easiest way to see the importance of interoperability is to look at what happens when interoperability isn\u2019t present. Currently, transportation technology companies have built proprietary ways of representing information that likely are similar to, but slightly different from, those used by other companies. In order to communicate with any other device, their applications have to be programmed, generally at additional expense, to understand one another. In many cases, this additional expense or hassle is replaced with countless staff hours doing double- and in some cases triple data-entry. The common results in either case are: Transit agencies and other mobility service providers encountering an extreme amount of friction in order to manage and operate service (especially changes to the service), Transportation system managers being unable to understand the full picture of the system in a consistent and up-to-date manner, Transit agencies and other mobility service providers experiencing difficulty accessing, validating, and aggregating the information they need to assess how the system they fund actually functions, and Extreme friction in time and cost in updating and upgrading any technology component to meet new requirements or take advantage of additional innovations. Travelers receiving information that is not reliable, diminishing their trust in mobility service providers. The high friction thus results in a technology marketplace where there are minimal incentives for: Incumbent transit technology providers to increase interoperability or innovate high-quality products and service, and Additional transit technology providers to enter the market. The current lack of interoperability restricts all mobility stakeholders from performing to the best of their ability. The result is often a poor customer experience, hampered innovation, and frustration for all parties. The broader impact for the transit industry is a reduction in the attractiveness of transit systems, which limits overall ridership growth. This is a grave loss to a society in which greater transit utilization is necessary for improving social and economic equity and environmental sustainability. An interoperable mobility industry would improve service quality and efficiency. Interoperability would also promote the ability of the transit providers and other mobility service providers to adapt to continuing changes in the mobility landscape, to more effectively plan service, and to spur innovation among transportation technology companies while helping them to contain costs. In other words, interoperability will support more cost-effective solutions for the generation and application of mobility data . This improved cost-effectiveness will conserve public dollars and promote the equitable distribution of benefits across both larger and smaller, better funded and cash-strapped transit systems. Interoperability is also the only way to progressively build the mobility ecosystems in a given area, allowing it to integrate, new modes, new partners (public or private) and new systems. It provides the ability to scale quickly. Another key aspect of interoperability is to insure that the local knowledge is always coming AND transferred back to the Transit agencies (when transportation technology companies compute full/part of the data) AND the Transportation system managers to ensure its reliability. How do these principles support interoperability ? \u00b6 The Mobility Data Interoperability Principles will help the transit industry and other mobility service providers move toward interoperability by encouraging the adoption and implementation of adopted and proposed open standards originating within the industry itself. The Mobility Data Interoperability Principles will clearly designate the roles that mobility providers and transportation tech companies must play in order to achieve interoperability . The Mobility Data Interoperability Principles will also serve as a benchmark for measuring individual organization\u2019s commitment to achieving interoperability . How were the Principles developed? \u00b6 The Principles were initially developed in Summer and Fall of 2021 using a collaborative and public process which involved several dozen public organizations, non-governmental organizations, academics, and private industry.

As much as possible, we (Cal-ITP) would like these principles to reflect a shared vision for transit technology components among the industry as a whole and reduce geographic fragmentation which is often used as an excuse for lack of implementation. As such, we hope to share authorship and ownership as much as is desired by other parties. \u201cSaying it together\u201d is way more powerful than \u201cCaltrans saying something\u201d....so if there is anything we can change in how we are approaching this so that we can all \u201csay it together\u201d, let us know! Instructions \u00b6 Add additional reviewers from your organization (or others!) in the Reviewers Table that you feel would strengthen the document through their review by adding their name to the table and commenting with their email address (Cal-ITP will invite). Review the document top-to-bottom and add specific comments or suggestions in-line. Add overall comments next to your organization in the Reviewers Table below Indicate anticipated support for the principles in the Reviewers Table(see descriptions) Check off your name in the Reviewers Table Questions? Feel free to ping the author Scott Frazier who is the product lead for the Principles as part of the Mobility Service Data stream of work for the Cal-ITP project. THANK YOU Admin Draft Discussion Session \u00b6 Held Wednesday July 14: 3-4 ET/2-3 CT/1-2MT/12-1 PT Agenda/Notes \u00b6 Background Status update High-level questions Concern: Is it possible to affect change this way? Group agreed this was a necessary but not sufficient step and that we shouldn\u2019t oversell the principals as \u201csolving everything\u201d. More work will be needed. Concern: Why this when there are other things? After discussing other related products, the group in attendance agreed that the Principles fill a needed gap. Agree on final decision process: No disagreement raised at the meeting for the proposed governance process which provides equal weight to all co-authors. Discussion of high-level issues: Right-sizing the purpose / scope [ see issue discussion ] Who are the \u201cdo-ers\u201d? [ see issue discussion ] How do we make sure not just \u201cbare minimum\u201d is implemented No other issues raised. Getting to a public draft Proposed process briefly referenced. Cal-ITP will ask for assent from tentative co-authors. What we heard \u00b6 While the vast majority of admin review comments reinforced the value and need for this document, the following higher-level concerns raised were as follows: Make definitions easy to access up front and in-line Definitions are now linked throughout the document via hypertext and a similar approach employed in the Principle\u2019s web mockup. Make sure mobility, transit, and MaaS are appropriately included consistently throughout the document Consistency in terminology has been addressed after admin draft editing was frozen. Improve clarity and definitions for (intended) \u201copen\u201d \u201cdata standards\u201d vs (not intended) \u201cstandards\u201d for \u201copen data\u201d. Based on a thorough discussion, reviewers reached consensus at \u201c open standard \u201d. Tell the story at a high-level better \u2013 with graphics Agreed. This will be addressed in the v1.0 release. Better define types of mobility data While previous drafts distinguished various requirements for different categories of data \u2013 the current draft just defers to the wishes of the mobility providers (and the regulators who regulate them) as to what to disclose. How does this relate with TCRP G-18? This would be supportive of any open standards that G-18 comes forward with; numerous reviewers meet with the G-18 team on a regular basis. We need a graphic identity and web presence that is cohesive and doesn\u2019t rely on a single organization. Agreed. All content has been moved to neutral internet locations. This is a huge scope - should we start smaller? Resolved via Admin Draft Discussion Session to be \u201ctransit first\u201d but inclusive of other mobility. Clarify the role of this document with respect to other, similar ones such as the California Minimum GTFS Guidelines. The authors have attempted to address this throughout. How is this feasible given a competitive private market who will prefer silos? How are these recommendations actionable? The Admin draft discussion participants believed this is a necessary but not sufficient first step. Broad agreement and consistency are required in order to make progress. Resolved Issues in Admin Review \u00b6 \u201cOpen\u201d Data Standards vs \u201cOpen Source\u201d Data Standards - RESOLVED \u00b6 Purpose : a term which encompases the attributes already defined. Desires : Consistency with terms already broadly used Clear in its meaning Decision : \u201cOpen Standard\u201d has been decided upon by the group and implemented throughout. Options Considered: Proposed term Comments Open Data Standard - Can be confused with \u201cstandards\u201d for \u201copen data\u201d - The terms \u201copen data standard\u201d and \u201c open standard \u201d are widely used when discussing schema and structure \u201cOpen data standard\u201d does have a different definition as referring to public data sets, which makes it confusing in this context. For example, see: [https://datastandards.directory/] Open-Source Data Standard - \u201cOpen source\u201d is for software ownership/management. Open Standard (selected) - This is the most widely accepted term for a data standard that is open and freely available for anyone to use. See: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard] \u201cOpen Standard for Data\u201d is another good formulation. See: [https://standards.theodi.org/introduction/what-are-open-standards-for-data/] Data typologies \u00b6 Purpose : to distinguish between the type of data which is required for internal system operations and may not be desired to be \u201cpublic\u201d and data which should be publicly consumable. Decision : No decision was needed because the distinction between these data types was eliminated from the principles text (as of now) Usage : As of the current draft, the implications of this apply only to if data should be published at a permalink. Desires : Consistency with terms already broadly used Clear in its meaning Application Area Scope Bookends \u00b6 Purpose : Determine whether or not interoperability should extend to such transportation tech components as toll roads, traffic signals, etc. Decision : Roadways operations, signals, tolls, etc to be excluded at this time in order to maintain a more manageable scope. Desires : Consistent approach for interoperability in conceptually linked transportation tech components including road management Scope narrow enough to support adaptability and implementability of draft principles Backend to/from User Experience Scope Bookends \u00b6 Purpose : To determine whether specific languages or formats need to be identified for purposes of assessing interoperability of systems or if abstraction better preserves the general principle of interoperability Decision : Remove specific references to programming languages and intra-product data storage formats, maintain specific input/output formats MaaS Operations Discussion \u00b6 Purpose : Determine if MaaS is included in this discussion? Decision : Use \u201cTransit Forward\u201d language, remaining inclusive of other mobility options Remove MaaS-specific or centering language Discussion points: Transit agencies have broader concerns about centering MaaS Inclusion of MaaS terminology can spark issues with co-authorship Many agencies lack policies around MaaS and are not ready for MaaS-specific discussions Other mobility providers and entities want multimodal mobility to continue to be a concern, acknowledge sensitivity of terminology at this stage Who is the \u201cdo-er\u201d in the recommendations? \u00b6 Purpose : Establish who the recommendations should be directed at Decision : Recommendations will continue to be pointed at Transportation Tech Components, individual units of hardware or software, rather than individuals or companies Reviewers \u00b6 The members of public transit, transportation system managers, academic researchers, national and state DOTs, and non-profit advocates were invited to review the admin draft starting on June 23 rd , 2021.

This will be addressed in the v1.0 release. Better define types of mobility data While previous drafts distinguished various requirements for different categories of data \u2013 the current draft just defers to the wishes of the mobility providers (and the regulators who regulate them) as to what to disclose. How does this relate with TCRP G-18? This would be supportive of any open standards that G-18 comes forward with; numerous reviewers meet with the G-18 team on a regular basis. We need a graphic identity and web presence that is cohesive and doesn\u2019t rely on a single organization. Agreed. All content has been moved to neutral internet locations. This is a huge scope - should we start smaller? Resolved via Admin Draft Discussion Session to be \u201ctransit first\u201d but inclusive of other mobility. Clarify the role of this document with respect to other, similar ones such as the California Minimum GTFS Guidelines. The authors have attempted to address this throughout. How is this feasible given a competitive private market who will prefer silos? How are these recommendations actionable?

The 6 th category, \u201cManage the mobility system (e.g. performance reporting, shift selection, non-revenue schedules)\u201d, is too broad. Performance Reporting is germane. Each mobility provider\u2019s internal processes, including shift selection and non-revenue schedules, are not germane. Internal processes should be explicitly excluded from this effort. This revision will encourage participation by the private sector. The 4 th and 5 th categories should be more explicit and combined: \u201cFacilitate communications and processes among the staff involved in providing rides (drivers, schedulers, dispatch and other on-board staff) involved in booking, assigning, providing and monitoring rides through hardware, software and protocols\u201d. While older systems separate the scheduling, trip assignment, dispatch, and monitoring processes, these are combined by the newer dynamic real-time ride providers. What we heard \u00b6 Paraphrased and combined for clarity and concision. Scope \u00b6 Concern Is the planning/modeling/analysis side of transportation within the scope of the Principles? There aren\u2019t any examples in this realm. Response Planning, modeling, and analysis are included in the scope of the Principles, but only to the extent that they are functions of an established stakeholder . For example, the Principles take into account the transit planning that takes place in the development of new schedules for an agency. There may likewise be modeling and analysis that is utilized to assess actual performance or the performance of potential alternatives. However, the Principles do not at this stage include long-term planning activities like construction of new transportation facilities, nor does it include traffic volume analyses, traffic light analyses, or any modeling related to these. These items were excluded from scope due to the feedback received during the Admin review period for the Principles, that a too-broad scope would significantly increase implementation challenges. Such items may be scoped in for a future version of the Principles. Implications of Principle 3 \u00b6 Principle 3 Transit agencies and other mobility service providers should have access to tools that present high-quality mobility data accessibly, equitably, and in real time to assist travelers in meeting their mobility needs. Concern Is Principle 3 arguing for public funding or provisioning of tools? Response No. Principle 3 positively asserts that mobility service providers are more able to provide high quality service to travelers when the technology they utilize is interoperable. Principle 3 is concerned with the qualities of market-developed tools and the ability of agencies to transition between suites of tools to find a solution that meets their needs. It is not intended to reference the means of procuring those tools. Equity Focus \u00b6 Concern There should be a principle that\u2019s focused on equitable access and outcomes The document mentions \u201cequity\u201d in a couple places, but this important theme should be strengthened throughout. Consideration should be added for social equity across demographic groups and equity in the transportation technology marketplace. Data alone can\u2019t solve all these challenges, but it would be great to have a principle in this document that indicates how all are worth pursuing. Unclear if the specific goal is to: provide access to trip planning and related data services equitably, to provide the actual transportation service equitably, and/or for equitable outcomes in terms of the real-world needs that travelers are trying to accomplish. Response The co-authors discussed the below options (modifications in bold): Options considered: Existing Principle 5 All individuals should be empowered through high-quality, well-distributed mobility data to find, access, and utilize high-quality mobility options that meet their needs as they see fit, while maintaining their privacy. Option 5-1 All individuals should be empowered through high-quality, well-distributed mobility data to find, access, and utilize high-quality mobility options that meet their needs as they see fit, while maintaining their privacy. Communities should then have access to the data necessary to advocate for a more equitable society and a more sustainable environment and economy. Option 5-2 All individuals should be empowered through high-quality, well-distributed mobility data to find, access, and utilize high-quality mobility options that meet individual, community, and planetary needs while maintaining individual privacy. Option 5-3 All individuals should be empowered through high-quality, well-distributed mobility data to find, access, and utilize high-quality mobility options that meet their needs as they see fit, while maintaining their privacy. Understand that these individual data play an important role in equity and sustainability at a community level. Option 6-1 All communities should be empowered through high-quality, verified, and accessible mobility data , to analyze and understand the impacts of transportation systems on the well-being of society and the environment. They should have access to data necessary to advocate for a more equitable society and a more sustainable environment and economy. After several meetings, the co-authors concluded that equity was more properly an initial motivating factor for the Principles themselves. Equity and sustainability were thus added to the Purpose statement within the document. Additionally, in order to reduce the perceived individualism of elevating travelers but not groups of people to the level of stakeholders, the group determined that the language should include a reference to the public at large as being stakeholders. 4. Who is the \u201cconsumer\u201d in Principle #4? \u00b6 Principle 4 Transit agencies, other mobility service providers, and consumers should be able to select the mobility technology components that best meet their needs. Concern Travelers or data consumers? If it\u2019s data consumers, that makes sense for modular \u201cbest of breed\u201d and \u201cbuild or buy\u201d models, where all agencies that produce and consume data can assemble the highest quality components for their needs and further improve in an iterative manner. If it\u2019s travelers/riders, that seems like a very different proposition \u2014 moving the point of integration from within agencies/providers/consuming apps to the riders themselves. Response That\u2019s interesting and could be a great eventual goal, but it is very complicated to tackle at this point and seems to distract from more immediate goals of improving interoperability across existing and near-term systems within agencies/providers. 5. Documented data formats list is suggestive but incomplete \u00b6 Concern Documented data formats list is suggestive but incomplete Response This is intentional at this stage. A more complete and comprehensive list will be developed as part of the implementation product: Mobility Dataverse. Changes made in response to Public Review Comments \u00b6 Concern Benjie de la Pena, SUMC SUMC suggests including community as key stakeholder of the Interoperability Principles. The current draft only considers transit agencies, mobility service providers, and individuals. The communities are not even contemplated. We suggest appending a sentence to the 5 th principle or (our preference) adding a sixth principle. Option A Principle #5. All individuals should be empowered through high-quality, well-distributed mobility data to find, access, and utilize high-quality mobility options that meet their needs as they see fit, while maintaining their privacy. Communities should then have access to the data necessary to advocate for a more equitable society and a more sustainable environment and economy. Option B Principle #6. All communities should be empowered through high-quality, verified, and accessible mobility data , to analyze and understand the impacts of transportation systems on the well-being of society and the environment. They should have access to data necessary to advocate for a more equitable society and a more sustainable environment and economy. Jamie M. Fischer The document mentions \u201cequity\u201d in a couple places, but this important theme should be strengthened throughout. Consideration should be added for social equity across demographic groups and equity in the transportation technology marketplace. Albert Kochaphum I would like for there to be an equity part of the interoperability principles, similar to the idea of data justice, where the focus just isn\u2019t on keeping data open and transparent, but also anti-discrimination of who gets access to use this information and on which platforms. Response Equity MDIP co-authors discussed equity as a component of the vision for this document. It was agreed on that communities are a stakeholder for the Interoperability Principles. Concern was expressed regarding the appropriate way to bring equity into the principles. Concern was expressed that in not mentioning equity, MDIP would lose meaningful mechanism to hold signers to pursuit of equity outcomes later on. Anti-discrimination In regards to the issue of anti-discrimination, that is (sort of) addressed in the implementation responsibilities\u2019s reliance on open standards which should be usable/consumable by any developer or app. That being said, there is a certain level of gatekeeping built in to MDIP at this point because discretion as to what information should be distributed and to whom is ultimately given to the Mobility Service Provider. Currently, this responsibility rests with the Transportation Technology Company in many/most cases. Action Modifications Made \u201cCommunities\u201d added as stakeholder to vision statement. Revised Principle 5 language. Concern Tiffany Huang Would like more clarity around sharing and data governance for GIS data.

Action Modifications Made Added explicit mention of \u201cGIS\u201d under definition of Mobility Technology Component point 5 Concern Jamie M. Fischer The vision for transit planners and transportation system managers should make reference to the context of land use, environmental, and socio-economic data that are often utilized in broader planning efforts.

Concern Jamie M. Fischer There are a few issues with grammar and clarity throughout. I will provide more specific notes ad suggestions by emailing a markup of the public draft. Response Received, thank you. Action Modifications made Grammar and punctuation updated based on recommendations. Concern Drew Dara-Abrams, Interline OpenStreetMap is a complicated example to cite. OSM\u2019s standard file format and API data format is XML, which isn\u2019t listed in this doc. OSM data is licensed under a \u201cviral\u201d license, some would argue doesn\u2019t fit the goals of \u201copenness\u201d in these principles \u2014 then again, others would argue it does. Also debatable is whether OSM has \u201ctransparent, inclusive governance.\u201d Much progress related to OSM actually happens outside of the OSM Foundation and its communication channels. We don\u2019t want to be \u201cdowners,\u201d but OSM is very mixed as a role model for other projects. Response MDIP agrees that OSM is not easily citable as an open technology. Action Modifications made OSM removed from examples Concern Steve White, GMV Syncromatics Re: Ability of Interoperability to enable MSPs to swap GPS units or onboard computers: This sounds nice in theory, but the fact of the matter is that the onboard unit used by a CAD/AVL system is more than just a \u201cGPS unit\u201d and these things are not going to be widely interchangeable even if they use commercial off the shelf hardware. An agency cannot simply swap out \u201cGPS units,\u201d because the GPS functionality is included in a tablet or computer-type piece of hardware that performs many other functions. Some companies develop their products on Android and some on Linux (both open source operating systems), and some use Windows or other type devices. I don\u2019t assume the interoperability principles would go so far as to define a specific OS or hardware architecture, so this entire point feels far-fetched to me. Only in the most basic GPS-only type deployments could it be possible \u2013 where multiple routers or single-purpose GPS trackers would use a TAIP or NMEA type standard. All of the other points in this section make sense. Response The language used here (\u201cInteroperability enables: Mobility service providers to easily change which GPS unit their CAD/AVL system uses because the old and new GPS units transmit data in an open standard and the CAD/AVL system ingests data in an open standard .\u201d) is or should be more directly focused on the intention of the co-authors to combat so-called vendor lock-in and the inability of Mobility Service Providers to secure the technology they want to use. The intention of this bullet point is not to suggest that interoperability means that a specific fine-grained technology will be able to work with another within a single vendor\u2019s suite of components necessarily (although the Principles might provide an incentive in that direction). In general, this point should be broadened so that it is about the expectation that interoperability will allow for MSPs to \u201cright-size\u201d their Mobility Technology Components to meet their existing and projected needs because those components will be better integrated into a larger Mobility Technology System. Action Modificaitons Made Replace existing language with: Mobility service providers to more easily receive the mobility technology components that meet the needs of their uses because components are better integrated into a larger mobility technology system, in which the transmission and ingestion of data is utilizing open standards.\u201d Additional Responses to Public Review Comments \u00b6 Concern Chloe Spano, Cityway How does MDIP result in ability of mobility service providers to use data from other MSPs? Through collaborative 1-to-1 agreements? Response Noted The statement in the MDIP vision (\u201cMobility service providers can\u2026 Easily use their data and data from other mobility providers to increase rider satisfaction and the customer experience through service efficiency and service quality.\u201d) references the ability of data to be more widely available to various consumers in an interconnected network of service provision. It is anticipated that interoperability will result in a fuller picture of mobility data for all providers without the need for private one-on-one agreements between operators. Concern Chloe Spano, Cityway Under implementation responsibilities: Transit Agencies and Governments should allow access keys to data consumers Response Noted This comment is posted in multiple locations in response to the use of the phrase \u201cwithout restriction\u201d to the access of data in open standard or proposed open standard format. The intention of MDIP is that access keys would constitute an acceptable means of making data available to parties designated by the transit agency or mobility service provider . Concern Chloe Spano, Cityway Change definition of published data so that data published via documented API \u201cmust\u201d (rather than \u201cmay\u201d) be granted via API key. Response Noted The impact of this change is that MDIP would not consider data to be published if the API operator were to make the data available without an API key. MDIP is allowing for but not mandating the use of API keys, and the default in some cases might well be for there to be no API key, which appears to be an acceptable use. Concern Steve Yaffe, Yaffe Mobility Consulting The definition of Mobility Technology Component is key and should be highlighted up front, as this defines which categories of data fields are necessary for interoperability - to efficiently provide inter-modal and/or multi-provider linked trips. The 6 th category, \u201cManage the mobility system (e.g. performance reporting, shift selection, non-revenue schedules)\u201d, is too broad. Performance Reporting is germane. Each mobility provider\u2019s internal processes, including shift selection and non-revenue schedules, are not germane. Internal processes should be explicitly excluded from this effort. This revision will encourage participation by the private sector. The 4 th and 5 th categories should be more explicit and combined: \u201cFacilitate communications and processes among the staff involved in providing rides (drivers, schedulers, dispatch and other on-board staff) involved in booking, assigning, providing and monitoring rides through hardware, software and protocols\u201d. While older systems separate the scheduling, trip assignment, dispatch, and monitoring processes, these are combined by the newer dynamic real-time ride providers. Response Noted In the published format we anticipate making the definitions easily available throughout the document using tooltips and/or links. The definition should be evident to readers from the first mention. Internal processes are not excluded from MDIP due to the desire through interoperability to help identify and eliminate existing gaps in the flow of data for mobility consumers/producers. Generally, there is not industrywide agreement on what constitutes internal processes and making a decision to exclude them here could result in a significant reduction in MDIP\u2019s ability to press the industry toward interoperability . Additionally, some MDIP coauthors are presently working with industry partners to standardize data for non-revenue services and shift selection. Concern Anat Caspi, Taskar Center for Accessible Technology I would very much like to see (and contribute to) implementation stories, as well as the production of presentation materials that would allow for dissemination of the principles. Specifically, it would be great to take after the model of Smart Growth America, develop the principles a little bit more, and offer advocates of the principles a coherent set of slides and instructional material from/through which they can evangelize the ideas in the principles. Response Noted This comment relates specifically to implementation of the principles and not to the document, however it seems like a good course of action for MDIP as we move into the post-v1-publication phase of promoting the principles. Concern Weston Shippy,Trillium Transit Happy with the product overall! The principles mention end users and mobility service providers as stakeholders who can benefit from interoperable data, but they don\u2019t mention planning/regulatory/DOTs or academic researchers. This omission may have been intentional, however, because they were discussed in the drafting process. Response Noted Planning/regulatory/DOTs are contemplated by the MDIP as being part of Transportation System Managers. Researchers are listed as an independent (albeit undefined) stakeholder in the Vision statement. Concern Sean Holman I believe that the development of open standards and open source tools is critical to the future of mobility. These principles embody the strength that comes from an aligned approach amongst complimentary projects like MDS, GBFS, and GTFS Response Noted Comment is supportive of the project. Concern Jamie M. Fischer The vision for transit operators and the discussion of interoperability \u2018s importance should include a reference to data validation, quality control, and cross-referencing. The vision for transit system managers should make reference to project selection and funding to meet emerging customer needs. Response Noted The language that has been selected for MDIP v1 is generally \u201cbest available\u201d and in \u201creal-time.\u201d The implementation responsibilities language has more expressive force where quality and validation are concerned. This may be an area to revisit in a future document, but for the time being validation and quality are viewed as areas of enforcement, rather than natural outgrowths of MDIP. Concern Jamie M. Fischer Re: read/write access requirement in Implementation Responsibilities: Is this reasonable for all transportation technology components? I imagine read-only access would be an easier sell - specifically because of the \u201cfree from cost\u201d detail. Write-access might require contractual relationships, unless I\u2019m not understanding the responsibility as written. Response Noted The stipulation may be overbroad given the broad construction of transportation technology components, resulting in a higher than desired implementation cost. | Language changed from \u201cread/write\u201d to \u201cread-only or read/write.\u201d The default assumption will therefore be read-only Concern Drew Dara-Abrams, Interline Re: Open Standards. The criteria will likely clash with approaches taken by some other orgs \u2014 SAE and the Alliance for Parking Data Standards come to mind. Maybe that is inevitable, but do consider reaching out to discuss Response Future Action MDIP will coordinate and communicate with SAE, ADPS, CEN and APTA Concern Steve White, GMV Syncromatics Regarding Implementation Responsibilities to support \u201cadopted and proposed open standards\u201d: My only comment here is that the \u201cproposed\u201d language should be removed. Until a standard is accepted and implemented by other parties, it\u2019s unlikely that even a vendor who is generally agreeable to open standards will start implementing it in hopes that it becomes widely adopted. I realize this is a bit of a catch-22, as the lack of critical mass adoption prevents a critical mass from agreeing to adopt a standard, but few companies will want to commit to adopting \u201cproposed\u201d standards until they see adoption. A good example of this is GTFS-ride for sharing historical APC data. We see the benefit of it, the standard is current, but adoption is so low that it makes no sense for us to invest in adopting it ourselves. Until scheduling providers that have customers in common with us actually adopt it, there is no reason for us to do so and our time is better spent on other endeavors. With that in mind, it would be difficult for us to commit to adopting \u201cproposed\u201d open standards. We would certainly commit to language that says we\u2019d utilize \u201cwidely adopted\u201d or \u201cindustry accepted\u201d open standards. This \u201cadopted\u201d language makes sense especially when you follow to the next sections in the document which say that transportation technology companies shall \u201ccollaboratively develop and adopt open standards where gaps currently exist.\u201d That is agreeable, because it comes with the assumption that other companies would adopt those standards, thus it becomes worth everyone\u2019s time to adopt and no single company would be left as the only one having wasted time adopting a standard that no other companies adopted. Response Noted The implementation responsibilities are the main enforcement backstop for the principles that prevent them from being merely aspirational. They are intended to serve as a benchmark against which the co-authors, prospective buyers, MSPs, communities, and other interested stakeholders can assess whether or not a given mobility technology component is or isn\u2019t interoperability compliant. This topic came up in Admin Review conversations and among co-authors who determined that it was reasonable to establish some definition for \u201cproposed open standard \u201d that has a higher threshold than merely existing, including the transition of the standard to an independent group for management. Public Draft Reviewers \u00b6 In addition to the co-authors and co-signatories, the public draft was distributed to a multitude of interested public-sector, public-interest, academic, and private-sector organizations and individuals. We received 13 formal reviews and edits ahead of the September 13 th 2021 deadline, of which the following organizations and individuals gave permission to disclose their names and affiliations (*for identification purposes only): Drew Dara-Abrams, Interline Technologies Chloe Spano, Cityway Weston Shippy, Trillium Solutions Katie Monroe, Transit App Steve Yaffe, Yaffe Mobility Consulting Sean Holman Albert Kochaphum, LA Metro Jamie M. Fischer, State of Georgia\u2019s Mobility Authorities Audrey Denis, Cubic Steve White, GMV/Synchromatics Inc. Co-author Application and Admission Process \u00b6 During the Public Review period, organizations were allowed to express interest in joining the co-authors of the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles before the publication of v1. On September 27, 2021, the co-authors met to establish a formal process for admitting new co-authors and to vote on applications for co-author status by four organizations. The co-authors expressed concern about the potential reputational impact on the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles that could be incurred if for-profit companies were allowed to join as co-authors. Additional concerns were raised including the potential for co-authors to have to pick winners and losers among for-profit applicants, the enforcement of the spirit of the principles, and the ability for the principles to be used primarily as a marketing tool by co-authors. The co-authors decided that the marginal benefit to elevating for-profit companies as co-authors rather than as co-signatories was smaller than the marginal cost of allowing for-profit companies to join the ranks of the co-authors of the Principles. Consequently, the co-authors have agreed upon the following process for the inclusion of new co-authors: New co-authors shall be accepted by application during an open call prior to the release of each version of the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles. Co-authors must be institutions, transit agencies, or other non-profit organizations. Applications will not be accepted from for-profit companies, nor shall such companies be considered eligible to apply. Upon receipt of an application from an eligible organization, the co-authors will schedule a vote on the question of admitting the organization as a co-author. The initial question will be one of unanimous consent: if there are no objections to the admission of the applicant organization, the co-authors will formally move to accept the applicant organization as a co-author. If there are objections, they will be stated and discussed. If the question of admitting the applicant organization should be called again following the discussion of objections, the applicant organization may be admitted with a majority (50%+1 vote) of all co-authors voting in favor. With this process established, consideration was taken up for the four applicant organizations for co-authorship under the new process prior to the release of v1. Of those organizations, three were for-profit firms (Cityway, Cubic, and Transit App) and thus ineligible under the new guidelines. These organizations will be notified of the policy and that their applications have therefore not been accepted. The fourth organization, the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology at University of Washington, was found to be eligible and was admitted as a co-author of the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles without objection. Pre-Final Release Co-Author Review \u00b6 Co-Author Review Meeting Minutes \u00b6 On September 28, 2021, all Proposed Responses to Public Review Comments and Requests for Changes were adopted without objection except for the requested changes by Co-Author Benjie de la Pe\u00f1a/SUMC on the topic of community representation, equity and sustainability. Concerns were raised in the objections about the focus on the individual over communities and in the subordination of community needs to individual needs in the proposed revision of the 5 th Principle. Additionally, concerns were raised in the objections about the proposed revision to the Vision statement, in particular that they did not address sustainability directly. On October 5, 2021, the Co-Author group was invited to a meeting to discuss the resolution of the outstanding objections and to develop new proposed revisions to address the Public Review comments. The meeting was opened with a reading of the proposed revisions to the Vision statement and Principle 5. Benjie de la Pe\u00f1a/SUMC presented his objections to the group, and stated that the main desires were the addition of a sixth principle to represent community empowerment and to move equity and sustainability from the Vision statement to the Purpose statement. The Co-Author group discussed concerns around adding a sixth principle for communities, particularly that there was not a clear nexus between the Interoperability Principles - which are intended to facilitate the movement of data between actors in a closed system, rather than to serve as an open data project - and community empowerment. Concerns were also raised about the self-defining nature of Communities - which to this point has not been a defined term within the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles. Concerns were also raised with the ability of the Co-Authors to serve as experts in the achievement of equity for communities, and with the potential for co-signatories to use the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles to \u201cequity-wash\u201d without meaningful implementation responsibilities. The group discussed potential equity-oriented implementation responsibilities, including a requirement for co-signatories to provide an appeals process, context, and justification for the creation of data types. Ultimately, the group came to an agreement that despite concerns around individualism, there wasn\u2019t a clear enough link between Interoperability Principles and community empowerment, or between community empowerment and equity, for inclusion at the Principle level in this document. Additionally, implementation responsibilities were not edited due in part to concerns about who the \u201cdo-er\u201d would be and the potential for additional requirements to affect existing commitments from co-signatories. The meeting concluded with the Co-Authors moving without objection to present the following changes to the full Co-Author group (Edits in bold): Amend the Purpose statement to read: The purpose of the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles is to foster a transit industry where mobility data flows freely and securely between systems, between operators, and between providers and the riding public, empowering transit agencies and other mobility service providers and transportation system managers to provide better service, improve the customer experience, and promoting equity and sustainability.

Fischer The vision for transit operators and the discussion of interoperability \u2018s importance should include a reference to data validation, quality control, and cross-referencing. The vision for transit system managers should make reference to project selection and funding to meet emerging customer needs. Response Noted The language that has been selected for MDIP v1 is generally \u201cbest available\u201d and in \u201creal-time.\u201d The implementation responsibilities language has more expressive force where quality and validation are concerned. This may be an area to revisit in a future document, but for the time being validation and quality are viewed as areas of enforcement, rather than natural outgrowths of MDIP. Concern Jamie M. Fischer Re: read/write access requirement in Implementation Responsibilities: Is this reasonable for all transportation technology components? I imagine read-only access would be an easier sell - specifically because of the \u201cfree from cost\u201d detail. Write-access might require contractual relationships, unless I\u2019m not understanding the responsibility as written. Response Noted The stipulation may be overbroad given the broad construction of transportation technology components, resulting in a higher than desired implementation cost. | Language changed from \u201cread/write\u201d to \u201cread-only or read/write.\u201d The default assumption will therefore be read-only Concern Drew Dara-Abrams, Interline Re: Open Standards. The criteria will likely clash with approaches taken by some other orgs \u2014 SAE and the Alliance for Parking Data Standards come to mind. Maybe that is inevitable, but do consider reaching out to discuss Response Future Action MDIP will coordinate and communicate with SAE, ADPS, CEN and APTA Concern Steve White, GMV Syncromatics Regarding Implementation Responsibilities to support \u201cadopted and proposed open standards\u201d: My only comment here is that the \u201cproposed\u201d language should be removed. Until a standard is accepted and implemented by other parties, it\u2019s unlikely that even a vendor who is generally agreeable to open standards will start implementing it in hopes that it becomes widely adopted. I realize this is a bit of a catch-22, as the lack of critical mass adoption prevents a critical mass from agreeing to adopt a standard, but few companies will want to commit to adopting \u201cproposed\u201d standards until they see adoption. A good example of this is GTFS-ride for sharing historical APC data. We see the benefit of it, the standard is current, but adoption is so low that it makes no sense for us to invest in adopting it ourselves. Until scheduling providers that have customers in common with us actually adopt it, there is no reason for us to do so and our time is better spent on other endeavors. With that in mind, it would be difficult for us to commit to adopting \u201cproposed\u201d open standards. We would certainly commit to language that says we\u2019d utilize \u201cwidely adopted\u201d or \u201cindustry accepted\u201d open standards. This \u201cadopted\u201d language makes sense especially when you follow to the next sections in the document which say that transportation technology companies shall \u201ccollaboratively develop and adopt open standards where gaps currently exist.\u201d That is agreeable, because it comes with the assumption that other companies would adopt those standards, thus it becomes worth everyone\u2019s time to adopt and no single company would be left as the only one having wasted time adopting a standard that no other companies adopted. Response Noted The implementation responsibilities are the main enforcement backstop for the principles that prevent them from being merely aspirational. They are intended to serve as a benchmark against which the co-authors, prospective buyers, MSPs, communities, and other interested stakeholders can assess whether or not a given mobility technology component is or isn\u2019t interoperability compliant. This topic came up in Admin Review conversations and among co-authors who determined that it was reasonable to establish some definition for \u201cproposed open standard \u201d that has a higher threshold than merely existing, including the transition of the standard to an independent group for management.","title":"Additional Responses to Public Review Comments"},{"location":"public_draft_review/#public-draft-reviewers","text":"In addition to the co-authors and co-signatories, the public draft was distributed to a multitude of interested public-sector, public-interest, academic, and private-sector organizations and individuals.

On September 27, 2021, the co-authors met to establish a formal process for admitting new co-authors and to vote on applications for co-author status by four organizations. The co-authors expressed concern about the potential reputational impact on the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles that could be incurred if for-profit companies were allowed to join as co-authors. Additional concerns were raised including the potential for co-authors to have to pick winners and losers among for-profit applicants, the enforcement of the spirit of the principles, and the ability for the principles to be used primarily as a marketing tool by co-authors. The co-authors decided that the marginal benefit to elevating for-profit companies as co-authors rather than as co-signatories was smaller than the marginal cost of allowing for-profit companies to join the ranks of the co-authors of the Principles. Consequently, the co-authors have agreed upon the following process for the inclusion of new co-authors: New co-authors shall be accepted by application during an open call prior to the release of each version of the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles. Co-authors must be institutions, transit agencies, or other non-profit organizations. Applications will not be accepted from for-profit companies, nor shall such companies be considered eligible to apply. Upon receipt of an application from an eligible organization, the co-authors will schedule a vote on the question of admitting the organization as a co-author. The initial question will be one of unanimous consent: if there are no objections to the admission of the applicant organization, the co-authors will formally move to accept the applicant organization as a co-author. If there are objections, they will be stated and discussed. If the question of admitting the applicant organization should be called again following the discussion of objections, the applicant organization may be admitted with a majority (50%+1 vote) of all co-authors voting in favor. With this process established, consideration was taken up for the four applicant organizations for co-authorship under the new process prior to the release of v1. Of those organizations, three were for-profit firms (Cityway, Cubic, and Transit App) and thus ineligible under the new guidelines. These organizations will be notified of the policy and that their applications have therefore not been accepted. The fourth organization, the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology at University of Washington, was found to be eligible and was admitted as a co-author of the Mobility Data Interoperability Principles without objection.","title":"Co-author Application and Admission Process"},{"location":"public_draft_review/#pre-final-release-co-author-review","text":"","title":"Pre-Final Release Co-Author Review"},{"location":"resources/","text":"Resources \u00b6 Meeting Recordings \u00b6 December 9 th 2021 Town Hall Meeting Presentations \u00b6 General Overview Presentation Short Presentation Handouts \u00b6 Overview one-pager Blurbs \u00b6 Longer Overview \u00b6 Public Transit, and the mobility services which support it, is a critical backbone to our environmental, economic, and societal well-being. Modern, easily-accessible and well-operated public transit depends on a complex system of operations and customer-oriented technology components which work together. Interoperable transit technology systems enable transit providers to plan service which is responsive to rider needs, improve service quality and efficiency, and adapt to continuing changes. Interoperability also encourages innovation among transportation technology companies while helping them to contain costs. Released in November 2021 after a collaborative public process, Mobility Data Interoperability Principles create an industry-agreed upon vision, definition and direction for achieving interoperability with clear roles and responsibilities. The Principles were collaboratively developed and refined over Summer and Fall of 2021 by dozens of public and private organizations and researchers through a public review process. Over sixty public and private signatories have committed to implementing the Principles. Organizations who are interested in publicly committing to the Principles and their faithful implementation can submit the form found at: Mobility Data Interoperability Principles . The Principles are co-authored by (in alphabetical order) the California Association of Coordinated Transportation, California Integrated Travel Project, Denver Regional Transportation District, ENTUR, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, Metro Transit (MN), the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, MobilityData, the Shared Use Mobility Center, the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology, Tri-Met, VIA Metropolitan Transit San Antonio, and Washington State Department of Transportation Public Transportation Division. Shorter Overview \u00b6 The Mobility Data Interoperability Principles provide clear objectives and implementation actions for the public and private sectors in order to make the critical connection between transit technology systems and better service.
